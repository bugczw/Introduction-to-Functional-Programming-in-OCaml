1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,040
Welcome to this course,

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,799
which is an introduction to functional programming,
using the OCaml programming language

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:20,380
A famous game developer, a fantastic programmer,
John Carmack, once said:

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,380
"Sometimes, the elegant implementation is a function."

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,470
"Not a method, not a class, not a framework.
Just a function."

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,480
Well, here, we will bring you in a journey,

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,620
which is an introduction to functional programming,

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,670
using the state-of-the-art OCaml programming language.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,320
With an exercise environment, right in your browser,

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,550
using ground-breaking technology
based on OCaml itself.

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,000
Yes, this means you will have nothing to install.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,030
Everything will work out of the box.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,780
At the end of this course,

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,789
we are sure you will fully understand
what John Carmack really meant.

15
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:01,460
What are the learning objectives for this course ?

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,479
We want you learn to program
using the functional style, in general.

17
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,680
But, in particular,
we will use the OCaml programming language,

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,549
and its advanced type system.

19
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:16,380
Discover how to manipulate complex data structures,

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,130
which are defined by the user in a very concise way.

21
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,150
And then start to explore other rich
and powerful features of the OCaml language.

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,860
And discover how the ecosystem around this language,

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,460
is being growing dynamically over the last years.

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,280
The course organization is very simple.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,990
We will have seven weeks.

26
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,259
Each week, more or less one hour of video,

27
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,790
which is splitted in short sequences.

28
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,850
You will have many exercises,

29
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,759
which are checked for you right in your browser.

30
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,860
We also provides some additional material,

31
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,360
if you want to know more about
the OCaml advanced applications

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,970
used in real life, by industrial users.

33
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:06,259
And, finally, you will have
a full fledged programming exercise.

34
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,899
You will have your hand to program
something which is interesting.

35
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,380
This will be a surprise for the end of the course.

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,010
The general plan.

37
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,780
An introduction and overview of
all the courses and the basic notion,

38
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,520
during the week 0,
which actually the one you are listen to.

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,800
Then we move on and start to learn about the
basic data types provided by the language.

40
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,080
How to define functions.

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,650
Then you will learn how to define basic data structures.

42
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,849
And then we will progress more into this subject.

43
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:47,470
And do also more advanced programming
using data structure.

44
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,370
In week 4, we really use the power
of a functional programming language:

45
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,849
learning how to use, define,
and manipulate higher order functions.

46
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,450
Then since OCaml is language which is functional,

47
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,080
but not necessarily only "pure",

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,690
in week 5,

49
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,760
we will also learn about exceptions,

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,680
input/output and others imperative constructs;

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,379
because in the OCaml programming language,

52
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,810
you can actually modify the state.

53
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,269
And then in week 6,

54
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:17,590
we'll start to learn about the advanced module system,

55
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,769
---that comes with the language---

56
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:23,980
and how to use it for providing data abstraction.

57
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,599
Well, this week, actually,
is organised in a few sequences.

58
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,440
The first one is the introduction to the course,

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,250
you are right here.

60
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,049
Then we provide some background
on functional programming in general:

61
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,769
some history and motivations.

62
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,230
In sequence 2, we move to the OCaml language,

63
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,209
we learn where it comes from,

64
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,360
what are the key features of the language.

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,090
And in sequence 3,

66
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,120
to let you understand why we are so excited
to use this programming language,

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,060
and to teach it to you,

68
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,890
you will meet some of the industrial and research users

69
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,340
and hear what they have to say
about this fantastic system

70
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,489
In sequence 4,

71
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,750
we overview the tools
and the development environment.

72
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,930
You will make your first steps
in the OCaml programming system.

73
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,760
And then will come a brief showcase
of some of OCaml's advanced features.

74
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,090
And in the final sequence,

75
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,950
we will just give you a short overview
of the available resources.
