00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,860
Welcome back,

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,969
this is the final sequence of the first week.

3
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,209
We will talk about some of the ressources.

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:07,939
that you have at your disposal for learning now.

5
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,519
But let me start by telling you that
this course is really self-contained.

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,980
You will not need anything more than
what is provided in the learning environment.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:25,160
But anyway, for curious minds, there are quite
a lot of ressources, available in the web and for free.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:32,100
The first pointer I would like you to follow is the <u>http://ocaml.org/</u> community website.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,980
This is a website that evolved over the last
years to bring together the community.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,030
You will have documentation and information
about all the available packages,

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,940
news, tutorials, a lot of things
that are useful to be aware of,

12
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,199
even if you don't need it for the course.

13
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:52,690
You can get general help
on forums and mailing-lists.

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,480
Let me start by saying very clearly,

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,019
that, during this MOOC, we really suggest you
to use the forum on the FUN platform,

16
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,280
right in the learning environment,

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,000
for the reason that you will find other people like you,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,570
which are progressing at a similar pace.

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,000
There are teaching assistants
that know exactly what is going on in this course

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,690
and are specifically here to help.

21
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,620
The other people are going to use exactly
the same environment.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,330
You will have support with the learning platform.

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,900
So this is really the first place
where you have to go.

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,720
And, in general, you should not need
to have anything else to follow this MOOC.

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,040
But if you really want to have a look,
there are interesting mailing-lists to explore.

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,540
There is the <u>ocaml-beginners</u> group on <u>Yahoo groups</u>.

27
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:42,660
There is an official <u>ocaml-list</u> still ran by INRIA,

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,580
where confirmed OCaml programmers
go to post questions, post information.

29
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,390
But this is an advanced mailing-list.

30
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:55,470
As always the netiquette is the same,
search archives before asking a question.

31
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,610
Don't ask elementary questions
on the advanced mailing list.

32
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,490
Start with the MOOC environment first.

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,980
But you also have books and manuals available.

34
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,390
There are many ressources, very valuable ones,
available for free online.

35
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,680
The first one is the OCaml user manual.

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,930
This comes from the designers of the language.

37
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,829
The lattest and always up-to-date version
is available exactly from this link here.

38
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,780
Of course, this is not a tutorial.

39
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,489
It's a user manual.

40
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:35,669
If you really want to have the precise specification
of each feature of the language that the reference point.

41
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,400
And there is a book which was written in 2000.

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,200
---yes, fifteen years ago, but still quite valuable---

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,200
from Emmanuel Chailloux,
Pascal Manoury, and Bruno Pagano.

44
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,989
It was originally written in French,
then translated into English.

45
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:54,709
It is vailable for free, again  from this link here.

46
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,249
It doesn't cover the most recent
advances in the language

47
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:01,349
but for the introduction, it is really beautiful.

48
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,200
And if you really want to know more about
the theory behind this,

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,810
I would strongly recommend you have a look to

50
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,600
the course notes by Didier Remy from
"Applied Semantics Summer School"

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,989
which was also held in the year 2000.

52
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,800
This gives you really the understanding of
how the system works inside,

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,599
from a theoretical point of view.

54
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,739
But then, if you look for more recent ressources,
there are many which are non free,

55
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,269
there are quite a few books available,
in English and in French.

56
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:36,169
Again, go to the <u>ocaml.org</u> community website,

57
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:40,590
where there is a comprehensive list of books.

58
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,560
So in conclusion, after this first week,
you should be setup to enjoy the course.

59
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,169
You have discovered the exercise environment,

60
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,760
you know where we are coming from.

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,000
And we are really looking forward seeing you next week,
to start the real technical journey with us.
