00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,430
Welcome, we are OCamlPro,
the leading company in OCaml development.

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,520
We are very proud and excited,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,260
to be part of the design team of this MOOC.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,040
At OCamlPro, we all come
from the research world.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,000
We participate in several R&D projects,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,520
with industrial and academic partners.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,939
And we edit software
at the state of the art

8
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,220
of academic research.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,369
We designed the platform that
you will use for you exercises.

10
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:30,090
It features a code editor
that checks your syntax,

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,160
points out your errors,

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,110
and automatically formats your code.

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,710
You can try your code on the fly

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,160
in the interactive OCaml interpreter.

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,350
Nothing needs to be installed

16
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,230
to enjoy learning OCaml.

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,000
Enjoy, as much as we did!

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,410
My name is Fabrice Le Fessant,

19
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,750
I am a researcher at INRIA,

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,679
I've been working with OCaml
for the last twenty years.

21
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:53,829
I decided at some point to create
the OCamlPro company.

22
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:54,879
I'm Mohamed,

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,359
At OCamlPro, I'm working on a software
that is called AltErgo,

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,989
that takes as input mathematical formulas,

25
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:06,950
and tries to prove
whether they are valid or not.

26
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,299
I am Thomas,

27
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,829
I work at OCamlPro as a PhD student,

28
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:14,049
the purpose of my job is to evaluate the potenial

29
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:18,280
uncaught exception of an OCaml program.

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,960
I'm Louis Gesbert,

31
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,210
my main project is the OCamlPachage Manager
(OPAM),

32
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,880
which is probably the first thing
you will install,

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,869
if you want to try OCaml on your own.

34
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:30,810
My name is Pierrick,

35
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,369
and I'm a PhD student at OCamlPro.

36
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,079
My job is to improve the safety

37
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,930
and the correctness of the OCaml compiler.

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,250
Yes! It's a lot of fun to work
with the OCamlPro engineers!

39
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,430
They are all working on different subjects,

40
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,680
state of the art research,

41
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,899
different application domains.

42
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a lot of fun to work with OCaml.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,229
The language is cool, plus, you always get
to work on interesting problems

44
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:02,450
when you work on OCaml.

45
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,770
I think OCaml is a really cool language,

46
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,840
what I like about it is
especially the pattern matching,

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,010
which solves many, many problems.

48
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,330
And the type system.

49
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,290
Even if it is sometimes a bit annoying
to write a program,

50
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,690
because the compiler says:
"Oh no! you can't do that!"

51
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,090
But... he is always right!

52
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,730
I really like OCaml because i know that

53
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,590
when I program in OCaml,

54
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,260
there is a range of errors
that I will not have in my code

55
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,260
such as null pointer exceptions
or implicit type casts.

56
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,510
I think I would be sad
if had to switch to another language.

57
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,800
I really like programming in OCaml everyday.

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:53,300
Welcome to OCaml!
